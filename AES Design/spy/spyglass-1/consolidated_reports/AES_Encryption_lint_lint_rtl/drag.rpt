DRAG (Design Risk Assessment Grade) REPORT:
DRAG Factor = (Detection DRAG factor + Correction DRAG factor) * #Design Units affected 

DRAG report source:
   /home/synopsys/SpyGlass-L2016.06/SPYGLASS_HOME/auxi/DRAG-data.csv

DRAG Factor mapping values:
   H(High)    : 1
   M(Medium)  : 0.5
   L(Low)     : 0.1

DRAG Factor definitions:
   Detection DRAG Factor :- Resource required to detect the problem in conventional method if not known early
   Correction DRAG Factor:- Resource required to correct the problem

Total DRAG Factor measured in the analysis = 0

Design Impact Abbreviations:
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Design Impact                  Short Description
===========================================================================================================================================================
FUNCTIONALITY                  An issue, if not corrected would cause incorrect, unpredictable or ambiguous functional behavior of the silicon 
RELIABILITY                    An issue, if not corrected can cause permanent or intermittent failures of the chip
TESTABILITY                    An issue, if not corrected would hamper the testability of the design (on the tester or in-situ operation)
POWER_EFFICIENCY               An issue, if not corrected can lead to power-inefficient design 
PHYSICAL_DESIGN                Issues, if not corrected could cause problems in PACT closure ( Performance, Area, Congestion and/or Timing) 
                               leading to schedule delays or sub-optimal chip
TIMING_CLOSURE                 Any aspect of RTL design that would impact or hinder timing closure in physical design
SIMULATION                     An issue, if not corrected could cause simulation hangs, inconsistent behavior across simulators,
                               unpredictable results or simulation-synthesis mismatches
SYNTHESIS                      An issue, if not corrected could cause synthesis hangs, unpredictable synthesis and inconsistent synthesis 
                               across industry standard synthesis tools
STA                            An issue, if not corrected, could cause static timing analysis problems
ATPG                           Any aspect of RTL design that could impact smooth running of ATPG tools and possibly testability of a design
EMULATION                      Reserved for future Use 
STYLE                          Non-conformance to prescribed coding styles in the company
REUSE                          An issue which could make design un-portable or un-reusable across multiple technology nodes or tool flows

Note1: Some of the rules do not have DRAG scores associated with them and are not included in the DRAG measurements. 
For example, information rules may not have specific design impact and custom rules may not have DRAG factors associated to them. 
DRAG factor and design impact data can be added/edited and the changes will reflect in the DRAG report results as per the user need.

Note2: Rules passed without messages can be read in file ./spyglass-1/AES_Encryption/lint/lint_rtl/spyglass_reports/passed-rules.rpt
