ELAB_3558 The instance referenced by defparam doesn't exist in DU.
ELAB_3559 Unmatched object type passed to parameter/generic in DU.
ELAB_3565 You have more connections to an instance than there are ports on the master.
ELAB_3566 You have made a connection to a named port on an instance, but that port name is not defined on the master.
ELAB_3569 You have made an illegal connection between a VHDL signal/port and a Verilog port of dissimilar types. For example, you may be trying to connect a VHDL signal of type std_logic to a Verilog vector port.
ELAB_3573 For example, you may be trying to connect a 1-bit Verilog signal to a port of type std_vector on a VHDL master.
ELAB_3574 For example, you may be specifying a string parameter in Verilog to match an integer generic on the VHDL master.
ELAB_3575 For example, you may have specified a VHDL string value for a generic map to a Verilog master in which the corresponding parameter is defined as an integer.
ELAB_3576 The master entity or module has defined one or more ports that you are not referencing on the instance. This is not allowed in VHDL or at mixed language interfaces.
ELAB_3577 For example, you may have a connection to a port 'input' when the master has no such port.
ELAB_3580 For example, the master of this entity/module may have a pin defined with a width of 2, but in your instantiation, you have connected a signal of width 3.
ELAB_3581 For example, the master module has a pin defined as input [3:0] in1, and you have connected the character literal '1' to that pin in the VHDL instantiation of that module. The character literal has width 1, so cannot match the width of the Verilog vector port.
ELAB_3582 "For example, the master module has a pin defined as input in1, and you have connected the string literal ""1" to that pin in the VHDL instantiation of that module. The string literal has width greater than 1, so cannot match the width of the Verilog scalar port.
ELAB_3584 For example, you have specified a Verilog port as input in1, and you are trying to connect a character literal 'a' to that port.
ELAB_3585 "For example, you have specified a Verilog port as input [3:0] in1, and you are trying to connect a string literal ""abc" to that port.
ELAB_3586 Unknown port direction for Verilog port.
ELAB_3587 Unknown port direction for VHDL port.
ELAB_3588 Probably you are defining a port as an output for the instantiated component, but it is a defined as an input on the master.
ELAB_3589 You have specified the a port on the Verilog master as inout, but the corresponding component port direction in VHDL has this part as input type.
ELAB_3590 You have specified the a port on the Verilog master as inout, but the corresponding component port direction in VHDL has this part as output type.
ELAB_3591 Probably you are defining a port as an input for the instantiated component, but it is a defined as an output on the master.
ELAB_3592 The component definition has one or more ports which are not defined on the entity/module definition.
ELAB_3593 For example, if the Verilog port is defined as an input, it would be incorrect to pass as string value to the corresponding VHDL instance connection.
ELAB_3594 For example, you specified a parameter foo = 17, and passed that parameter to a VHDL master, in which the corresponding generic foo is defined as std_logic.
ELAB_3595 This may happen as a result of an ELAB_3593 error - an invalid parameter value was passed to a generic, which therefore does not have a match.
ELAB_3596 You have a for ... use ... statement in your VHDL that forces binding of an instance to a non-existent master. If this statement is removed, it is likely that this instance will bind successfully to a Verilog master.
ELAB_3597 Some constructs are not being supported across mixed language boundary.
ELAB_3598 You have passed a generic map value for a (generic) name that has no corresponding parameter in the corresponding Verilog master.
ELAB_3600 The range of a signal or other object is defined by a generic, for which no value has been specified.
ELAB_3601 Out of range. Actual during instantiation is out of range.
ELAB_3602 Invalid connection type. Output port externally connected to register type net.
ELAB_3603 You are referencing, from Verilog, a component in a VHDL logical library but the library cannot be found (or has not been defined). For example, if you reference:  \mylib.cpu cpu(...)then the cpu entity should be found under the VHDL logical library mylib
ELAB_3604  Constraint can't be set. Actual size is not divisible by formal size
ELAB_3605 The instance is connecting objects with unconstrained ranges to the Verilog master. For example:  type foo is array(natural range <>, natural range <>);  ...  entity X is port(signal input: in foo; signal output: out foo);There is no way for any tool to determine where the input signal will end and the output signal will start, when the port list is viewed as a list. Moreover this is both unsynthesizable and cannot be connected to a Verilog master (since Verilog does not support a concept of unconstrained ranges)
ELAB_3606  
ELAB_3607 A value used in a generic map is not statically determinable - it depends on a generic or other parameter for which no value has been specified
ELAB_3608  OPEN is not a legal actual part of an element association for an input port
ELAB_3609 "You are trying to base a bit string (e.g. ""1010") to a scalar port on a Verilog module
ELAB_3610 You have directly referenced a UDP from VHDL. We do not support direct references to UDPs.
